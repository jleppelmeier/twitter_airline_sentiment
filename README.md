# twitter_airline_sentiment

A project to test Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine Classifiers on the text data from the Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset. This was a group project at UM - Flint, in the Spring 2019 Advanced Data Mining Course

All notebooks were originally developed online using Colaboratory. 

`Tweet_Sentiment_Naive_Bayes_1.ipynb` was developed as a notebook to train and test a Naive Bayes classifier for predicting tweet sentiment. This notebook was developed by Nikita Mary Sobers and Jason Leppelmeier. 

`airline_sentiment_SVM.ipynb` was developed as a notebook to train, optimize, and test an SVM classifier for predicting tweet sentiment. This notebook was developed by Jason Leppelmeier.
